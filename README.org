* pycoz

Pycoz is a hacky implementation of containers for linux - it serves educational purposes only.

On Fedora based systems you will need following packages installed:
- git
- python
- swig
- redhat-rpm-config
- seccomp-devel
- kernel devel

** Environment

To maintain a good hygiene we will start by creating a new python virtual env for our project and
we will run shell inside it

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

** TBD live!
